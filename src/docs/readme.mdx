  <h1>Lite JS Utils</h1>
  <h3>Lot of methods to use in JS/TS applications.</h3>
</p>

<br /> <br/>


## Why Lite JS Utils?

It is common in our JS / TS applications to install complete packages (moment, lodash ...) just to use some methods. The lite-js-utils project was created precisely to meet the need to install large packages just for the use of common methods. See the [full docs](https://lite-js-utils.herokuapp.com/) for a list of available methods.
