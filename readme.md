# Why Lite JS Utils?

It is common in our JS / TS applications to install complete packages (moment, lodash ...) just to use some methods. The lite-js-utils project was created precisely to meet the need to install large packages just for the use of common methods. See the [full docs](http://docs) for a list of available methods.
